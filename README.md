# Automated Checkout using EfficientDet: Object Detection for Supermarkets

# Description:
This project involves building an object detection model using EfficientDet, a state-of-the-art deep learning convolutional neural network, to automatically detect and recognize products checked out by customers in supermarkets. The project utilizes the Retail Product Checkout Dataset to train and test the model.

# Abstract:
The objective of this project is to develop an object detection model that enables supermarkets to automate the checkout process by recognizing and identifying products checked out by customers. The project uses the Retail Product Checkout Dataset, which contains over 90,000 images of products from various categories, to train and evaluate the model. The EfficientDet architecture is employed to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the training time of the model. The model is evaluated using standard performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate that the model can accurately identify and localize products in checkout scenarios, paving the way for the deployment of automated checkout systems in supermarkets. The code and trained models are made available in the repository for easy replication and further development.
